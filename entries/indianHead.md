## Description

The Indian Head cent was minted from 1859 to 1909. It has a native American on the obverse and a reef with the words one cent on the reverse.

## History

During the civil war the copper was needed for the war so the mint made the pennies thinner to conserve on copper.

## Other

The Indian Head penny was the last penny that did not have President Lincoln on it.
