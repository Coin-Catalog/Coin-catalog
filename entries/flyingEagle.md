## Description

The flying eagle cent was minted from 1856 to 1858. But they were only put into circulation in 1857. On the obverse, it had an eagle that was flying, and on the reverse a reef with the words one cent.

## History

In the 1850s the price of copper was rising and if they kept the penny how it was (Large cents) the pennies would cost more than 1 cent to mint. So they decided to make the penny small (the size we have today) to solve the problem.
